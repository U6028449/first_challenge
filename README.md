## Description

Weekly challenge

This project was created for the purpose of providing the student a controlled enviroment to practice the lessons covered throughout week one, with the main focus being cleaning up code.

## Focus of Content 


- [HTML]
- [CSS]
- [GitHub]
- [Command Line Interface]

 HTML code was given to the student with code that was not optimized or working properly.  
 Students applied lessons learned from class to enhance the provided code and fix issues
 while becoming more proficient in working within HTML.

 CSS was further developed to provide students familiarization with the different capabilaties 
 and effects that can be applied to HTML using CSS.

 GitHub is the repository that was used for students to manage, push, track, and publish changes
 to the project. Getting familiar with GitHub will be important for students as projects continue 
 to increase in scope and difficulty.

 Command Line Interface is the main way this project was communicated between VS Code, and 
 GitHub. Stundents will utilize the CLI throughout the course and this project was a simple
 way for students to gain and understanding of various commands that can be used.
